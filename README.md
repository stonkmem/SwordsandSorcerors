# FlaskAppsns
## Overview
Tallyho ye Masters of the Dungeon! This was a project I made using Flask! It was initially supposed to be a full DM suite for Dungeon Masters running Tabletop Roleplaying Games, featuring more features (e.g. random name generators, random character generators styled after those for Mork Borg, etc.), but this is just a bare bones project I made in 2021. It's a fairly basic application, with only a diceroller and a dream to its name, and I do hope to work on it one day after remembering how to use Flask again :P \\
The actual project just consists of the main DM Resources page that redirects to my custommade Swords and Sorcerors dice roller!
